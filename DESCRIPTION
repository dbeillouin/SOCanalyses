Description: 
    This package analyses the results of meta-analyses studying the effect of human interventions on soil carbon. 
    The analyses are based on a systematic synthesis of the available literature on the CIRAD repository (https://doi.org/10.18167/DVN1/KKPLR834).
    The database is described in Beillouin et al. 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01318-1).
